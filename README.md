This repository is a collection of various codes and projects that I’ve created for my learning purposes. It’s essentially a dump of all the small and large projects I’ve worked on while learning JavaScript and related technologies.

Projects Included :-

    -Calculator: A basic calculator to practice arithmetic operations and DOM manipulation.
    -To-Do List: A simple to-do list app to learn event handling and local storage.
    -Blog App: A basic backend REST API for a social media platform using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
    -Weather App: A weather app that fetches data from an API, focusing on asynchronous programming.
    -Memory Game: A classic memory game to explore game logic and state management.
    -Quiz App: A quiz application to practice using arrays, objects, and conditional rendering.
    
Feel free to explore, fork, or modify any of the projects. This repo is more of a personal sandbox where I experiment and learn, so you might find a mix of different approaches and code styles as I try out new things.
